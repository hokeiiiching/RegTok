Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,"To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout.",Yes,The feature is designed to enforce a curfew for minors specifically within Utah's boundaries to comply with the state-level Utah Social Media Regulation Act.
PF default toggle with NR enforcement for California teens,"As part of compliance with California’s SB976, the app will disable PF by default for users under 18 located in California. This default setting is considered NR to override, unless explicit parental opt-in is provided. Geo-detection is handled via GH, and rollout is monitored with FR logs. The design ensures minimal disruption while meeting the strict personalization requirements imposed by the law.",Yes,The feature is explicitly designed to apply different default settings to users under 18 in California to comply with a state-specific law.
Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,"In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC, this feature scans uploads and flags suspected materials tagged as T5. Once flagged, the CDS auto-generates reports and routes them via secure channel APIs. The logic runs in real-time, supports human validation, and logs detection metadata for internal audits. Regional thresholds are governed by LCP parameters in the backend.",Yes,"The feature description explicitly states that 'Regional thresholds are governed by Local Compliance Policy parameters in the backend,' which necessitates geo-specific compliance logic."
Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,"To meet the transparency expectations of the EU Digital Services Act, we are introducing a visibility lock for flagged user-generated content labeled under NSP. When such content is detected, a soft Softblock is applied and GH ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace supports traceability, and Redline status can be triggered for legal review. This feature enhances accountability and complies with Article 16’s removal mechanisms.",Yes,The feature's enforcement is explicitly described as being restricted to the EU region to comply with the Digital Services Act.
Jellybean-based parental notifications for Florida regulation,"To support Florida's Online Protections for Minors law, this feature extends the Jellybean parental control framework. Notifications are dispatched to verified parent accounts when a minor attempts to access restricted features. Using IMT, the system checks behavioral anomalies against BB models. If violations are detected, restrictions are applied in ShadowMode with full audit logging through CDS. Glow flags ensure compliance visibility during rollout phases.",Yes,"The feature is explicitly designed to comply with 'Florida's online protections for minors law' (HB3). Its functionality, which provides parental notifications, directly addresses the requirements for parental control tools outlined in the law. The feature description itself mentions 'geo-based alerts' and is named for the 'florida regulation', confirming it must be targeted to users in that specific geography."
Unified retention control via DRT & CDS,"Introduce a data retention feature using DRT thresholds, ensuring automatic log deletion across all regions. CDS will continuously audit retention violations, triggering EchoTrace as necessary. Spanner logic ensures all platform modules comply uniformly.",Yes,A uniform global data retention policy will conflict with varying regional laws that mandate different minimum or maximum data retention periods for law enforcement and data minimization purposes.
NSP auto-flagging,"This feature will automatically detect and tag content that violates NSP policy. Once flagged, Softblock is applied and a Redline alert is generated if downstream sharing is attempted.",Yes,"The feature applies a user-level limitation 'silently without notifications'. This directly conflicts with the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires platforms to inform users about content moderation decisions and provide them with an opportunity to appeal. To be compliant in the EU, this feature requires geo-specific logic to include user notifications and an appeal mechanism."
T5 tagging for sensitive reports,"When users report content containing high-risk information, it is tagged as T5 for internal routing. CDS then enforces escalation. The system is universal and does not rely on regional toggles or GH routes.",Yes,"The definition of ""high-risk information"" that triggers a ""tier 5"" tag varies significantly by jurisdiction based on local laws, such as the definition of ""illegal content"" under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) versus specific reporting mandates in the US. Therefore, the system requires geo-specific logic to correctly identify and classify such content."
Underage protection via Snowcap trigger,"Snowcap is activated for all underage users platform-wide, applying ASL to segment accounts. Actions taken under this logic are routed to CDS and monitored using BB to identify deviations in usage.",No,"The feature describes a platform-wide system using internal codenames not tied to any specific regulation, indicating it is a general safety measure rather than a geo-specific compliance feature."
Universal PF deactivation on guest mode,"By default, PF will be turned off for all uses browsing in guest mode.",No,"The feature is applied universally to all guest users regardless of their location, which negates the need for geo-specific logic."
Story resharing with content expiry,"Enable users to reshare stories from others, with auto-expiry after 48 hours. This feature logs resharing attempts with EchoTrace and stores activity under BB.",Yes,"The feature generates activity logs which, under Utah's law, must be made accessible to the parents of minor users, requiring geo-specific logic to apply this rule."
Leaderboard system for weekly creators,Introduce a creator leaderboard updated weekly using internal analytics. Points and rankings are stored in FR metadata and tracked using IMT.,Yes,"The creator leaderboard functions as a recommendation system, which requires transparency about its ranking logic under the EU Digital Services Act."
Mood-based PF enhancements,Adjust PF recommendations based on inferred mood signals from emoji usage. This logic is soft-tuned using BB and undergoes quiet testing in ShadowMode.,Yes,"The feature uses profiling based on emoji usage to adjust recommendations for Pathfinder, which requires user opt-out functionality under the EU DSA's Article 22."
New user rewards via NR profile suggestions,"At onboarding, users will receive NR-curated profiles to follow for faster network building. A/B testing will use Spanner.",Yes,The feature is a recommendation system that requires specific transparency and user control logic under geo-specific regulations like the EU DSA and California's minor protection laws.
Creator fund payout tracking in CDS,Monetization events will be tracked through CDS to detect anomalies in creator payouts. DRT rules apply for log trimming.,No,"The feature concerns internal financial tracking and anomaly detection for creator payouts, which is not regulated by the EU Digital Services Act's focus on content moderation, advertising, and recommender systems."
Trial run of video replies in EU,"Roll out video reply functionality to users in EEA only. GH will manage exposure control, and BB is used to baseline feedback.",Yes,"The feature is being launched specifically in the EEA, which requires compliance with the EU Digital Services Act's rules on content moderation and recommendation systems."
Canada-first PF variant test,Launch a PF variant in CA as part of early experimentation. Spanner will isolate affected cohorts and Glow flags will monitor feature health.,No,"The feature launch is specific to Canada, a jurisdiction not covered by the provided US and EU regulations."
Chat UI overhaul,"A new chat layout will be tested in the following regions: CA, US, BR, ID. GH will ensure location targeting and ShadowMode will collect usage metrics without user impact.",No,"The feature is a standard UI A/B test and does not engage with the specific requirements of the provided regulations, which focus on addictive features for minors or content moderation transparency."
Regional trial of autoplay behavior,"Enable video autoplay only for users in US. GH filters users, while Spanner logs click-through deltas.",Yes,"The feature enables autoplay for all US users, but California's Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act restricts autoplay for minors, requiring a state-specific implementation."
South Korea dark theme A/B experiment,A/B test dark theme accessibility for users in South Korea. Rollout is limited via GH and monitored with FR flags.,No,"A/B testing a dark theme is a standard UI/accessibility feature not covered by the provided regulations concerning content, minor safety, or addictive designs."
